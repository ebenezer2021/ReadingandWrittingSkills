Then they meet Giulia, a strong willed girl who invites them to team up for the town’s annual race against the arrogant bully, Ercole. But as Luca grows closer to Giulia, Alberto starts to feel left behind, leading to a painful falling out.</p>
        <p>When Alberto reveals his true sea monster form in a moment of frustration, Luca, afraid of being exposed, pretends not to know him. Hurt and betrayed, Alberto disappears. But when it starts to rain during the race threatening to reveal Luca’s secret to the whole town he makes a choice. Instead of running, he embraces who he is, standing by Alberto’s side. To their surprise, Giulia and even some of the townspeople accept them for who they are.</p>
        <p>In the end, Luca follows his dream of going to school, while Alberto finds a new home with Giulia’s father. Their goodbye is bittersweet, but their friendship remains unbreakable. Luca is a heartwarming tale about stepping out of your comfort zone, embracing who you are, and finding the people who truly accept you.</p>

Without hesitation, Sōsuke promises to care for her, sealing their bond and restoring balance to the world.</p>
